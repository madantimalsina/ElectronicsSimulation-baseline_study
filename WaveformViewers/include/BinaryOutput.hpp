/**
 * Class providing the implementation of the .bin output file format, in
 * agreement with the DAQ binary format.
 *
 * If this class is used for output, then the output of the DER simulation will
 * contain the output data in the same format that the DAQ would
 * produce. In addition, a number of other files are written that contain
 * information about how the simulation was run, as well as the data rate.
 *
 * N.B. Take care! Just like in real LZ, the binary format output supports
 * up to only events in the range 1-65535, i.e. a total of 65534 events in one
 * simulation file.

     * Explanation of this structure is useful here.
     *
     * The struct DCPointers contains two sets of vectors:
     * FileEvtPtr refers to the position in the binary file.
     * There are as many entries in the vector as there are events
     * in that binary file.
     *
     * What does FileEvtPtr represent?
     * It is the position of the variable inside the binary file that
     * contains a number.
     *
     * What does that number refer to?
     * The number is the offset from the start of the
     * binary file where the event starts.
     *
     * How do we determine that number?
     * The number is determined while the data is being written to the
     * file. Once the number is known, it is stored inside EvtStrtPtr.
     *
     * The number is effectively a pointer. When someone opens the
     * binary file they can look up the location in the binary file
     * where each event starts.
     *
     * The structure should be clear now:
     * FileEvtPtr represents where the event pointer is stored.
     * EvtStrtPtr represents the location in the file where that event
     * starts. There is such a pair for each event in the file.
     *
     * Do the positions differ per DC file?
     * Yes. The EvtStrtPtr differs per DC file because it depends on
     * how much data was written for each event. If one DC file
     * contains more PODs than another DC file, then the next event
     * would start at a later position in the file. This is why
     * a std::vector<DCPointers> DCEvtPtr is needed. It tracks where
     * each event starts for each DC file.
     *
     * The FileEvtPtr locations do not differ per DC file, because
     * the pointers themselves are positioned at the top of the
     * binary file, before any event information is written.
     *
