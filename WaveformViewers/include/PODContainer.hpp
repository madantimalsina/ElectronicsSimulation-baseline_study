/**
 * Class providing the necessary interface and tools to form PODs from
 * digitised pulse objects.
 *
 * The typical usage of this class is: provide a pulse from a given channel and
 * event. Then pass it to the makePODfromPulse method. This method will store
 * all the PODs on this pulse inside a vector of POD objects. Each POD object
 * inside this vector then contains the ADCC values of each POD as well as the
 * associated time and event information.
 *
 * After this is done, the PODs are extracted from the getNextPOD() method,
 * where the user of the class provides a loop which checks the conditional
 * hasMorePODS() to extract them all.
 *
 * In future this class will change internally for improved performance.
 * It is not anticipated that the usage of the class will change external to
 * this class.
